            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F in a time of ſo great and eminent danger to Religion and the cauſe of God, the Trumpet in Zion ſhould give no certaine ſound, nor the watch-mens Tower any ſeaſonable warning, it might be juſtly charged upon us as a ſinfull neglect of duty, and the blood of many thouſand ſouls might be required at our hands. Therefore ſo far as we have diſcovered the dangerous plots and ſnares of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and crafty adverſaries of this cauſe; We ſhall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully make the ſame known; truſting that all who would not make ſhipwrack of faith and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will carefully avoid as well hid as manifeſt rocks, when they are warned of them.</p>
            <p>After the ſolemn League and Covenant of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes had ſo proſpered againſt the enemies and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers thereof, as made them diſpaire of overthrowing it in any ſuch way of a direct oppoſition; They begun with much wit and induſtry to indeavour a dividing of the ends of the Covenant, and an altering of the firſt principle and ſtate of the cauſe. Upon the one hand, the Sectaries in Englands, (according as is formerly repreſented by the late Generally Aſſembly in their Declaration to their Brethren
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43214:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>of England, and by our Remonſtrance to the Committee of Eſtates of the 13. of <hi>Octob.</hi> laſt) have by fraud and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence endeavoured the ſubverſion of Religion; whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant inſolency being now in Armes is ſo unſupportable, that no man can doubt but all the Articles of the Covenant are in danger by them; the vile errours, wicked hereſies, and intolerable blaſphemies daily growing among them can hardly be reckoned up; all which are mightily aggredged by the lawleſſe and godleſſe toleration thereof; and leaſt Parliamentary authority ſhould curb this monſtrous inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, they have not onely refuſed Orders for disbanding, but have forced Orders for their own ſtanding, and do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule Parliament, King, City, and Country to the trampling under foot all government Civill and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, and to the terrour, oppreſſion, and apparent ruine of all the truly, godly, and ſound lovers of the ſolemn League and Covenant. On the other hand the Prelaticall and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant party have catched at, and ſtudied to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſome parts and clauſes of the Covenant, without keeping all the links of that golden chain faſt together.</p>
            <p>This deſign of receding from the former principles, and ſtating the publike cauſe otherwiſe then it was ſtated by both Kingdomes when they joyned in Covenant and Armes, may abundantly be diſcovered by two inſtances; Firſt, the deſigne hath been ſo faſt and ſo far driven on, that although the fourth Article of the League and Covenant was clearely framed and intended againſt the Malignant party; And although there was one expreſſe Article in the Treaty between the Kingdomes for ſwearing and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the League and Covenant by both Kingdomes as a more near tye and conjunction of both for their defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Popiſh Prelaticall and Malignant party and their adherents; And although in the Declaration of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the year 1643. It was declared that all ſuch as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43214:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>would not ſpeedily take the Covenant, and joyne with all their power in defence of this cauſe, are to be cenſured and puniſhed as profeſſed <hi>Adverſaries</hi> &amp; <hi>Malignants;</hi> Yet ſome are not a ſhamed to plead for the Malignant party, as if they were friends rather then enemies to this cauſe, and as none were now to be looked upon as dangerous enemies to the cauſe, but the Sectaries only; whereas the word of God and the experience of former times not only teacheth us to beware of dangers from the fraud, as well as the force, from the plots as well as from the power of enemies; but alſo ſetteth before us ſad examples of great unexpected miſeries, and miſchiefs brought upon the people of God, from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies once broken and quaſhed, when they got again the power of the ſword, &amp; opportunity to act whatſoever cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties their inveterate malice &amp; enraged ſpirits put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upon.</p>
            <p>The other inſtance is, that although in the Covenant, the duty of preſerving and defending the Kings Majeſties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and authority be joyned with, and ſubordinate unto the duty of preſerving and defending the true Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdomes; &amp; although from the beginning of this cauſe, the good ſafety &amp; ſecurity of Religion hath been principally ſought after and inſiſted upon: yet ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, perſwaſions, and indeavours have not been, nor are wanting for His Majeſties reſtitution to the exerciſe of His royall power, and for expouſing His Majeſties quarrell, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his not granting of the publik deſires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Covenant, and Religion: And this courſe is clearely contrary to the declared reſolution of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of this kingdome, after advice deſired from us, upon the caſe concerning the King then propounded to us; And it is no leſſe contrary to the principles and profeſſions of the convention and of the Committee of Eſtates, before any ſuch advice was deſired or had from us: yea all along, and in the whole courſe of the publike proceedings, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43214:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſetling and ſecuring of Religion hath been ſo much ſtood upon, that Malignants who intended a new ſtate of the cauſe did well perceive how great difficulty, and how ſmall hopes there was of ſatisfying this Kirk and Kingdom with any thing elſe, while unſatisfied in the point of Religion; and therefore all poſſible care hath been taken by them whereby to have ſome ſpecious and fair pretences of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the buſineſſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>And here, as we do not diſapprove, but highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the worthy pains of ſuch as did indeed endevour to bring the Kings Majeſty a greater length, even to give full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in point of Religion; ſo we cannot but take notice of that report which many did lately entertain and ſpread in this Country; namely, that His Majeſty hath given ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the deſires of this Kirk and Kingdom in point of the Covenant and Religion.</p>
            <p>If His Majeſty had indeed given ſuch ſatisfaction, we ſhould rejoice at it as much as any, and however ſhall not ceaſe to pray for his Majeſty, that God would give him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance &amp; remiſſion of ſins, &amp; incline his heart to the love of the true Religion and Reformation, and that his Royall Perſon may be preſerved from all harm &amp; violence: And being now (as we formerly remonſtrate on <hi>Octob.</hi> 13.) very ſenſible of the preſent danger his Majeſties perſon &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall government is into by that prevalent party of Sectaries; We ſhall, ſo far as concerneth the duty of our places &amp; callings, endevour the preſervation of Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call government in his Majeſty, and his poſterity according to the Covenant; not being ignorant what confuſions and calamities uſe to attend the change either of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, or of the Royall line. Nevertheleſſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being ſo generally poſſeſſed with ſo dangerous a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and miſunderſtanding of ſo great a buſineſſe; and his Majeſty himſelf profeſſing in his Letter to us, dated at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbrook</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43214:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Caſtle, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 27. laſt, that he hath reſolved ſo far to agree to the deſires of this Kirk &amp; Kingdom concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Covenant and ſetling Religion, as he is confident ſhall give us ſatisfaction; If now we ſhould be ſilent, we might be underſtood as tacitely conſenting &amp; acquieſcing. We are therfore neceſſitated for undeceiving the Nation, &amp; for acquitting our ſelves, to declare that a narrative of the ſtate or publick affairs, having bin made to us by thoſe who were entruſted for that effect, &amp; ſince delivered to us in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we have more eſpecially taken to our ſerious thoughts ſo much of that narrative as was from his Majeſty made known unto us, his reſolutions for ſatisfaction in point of Religion, The firſt Article whereof is as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For the Covenant, his Majeſty giving belief to the profeſſions of theſe who have entred into the League and Covenant, and that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are reall for preſervation of his Majeſties perſon according to their allegiance, and no waies to diminiſh his juſt power and greatneſſe, is content ſo ſoon as he can with freedom, honour, and ſafety, be preſent in a free Parliament to confirm the ſaid League and Covenant by Act of Parliament in both Kingdoms, for ſecurity of all thoſe who have taken, or ſhall take the ſaid Covenant, provided that none who is unwilling ſhal be conſtrained to take it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Article hath nothing in it of his Majeſties affection to, or liking and approbation of the Covenant, but only what he is content to yeild in order to His own intereſt. Yea, an Act of Parliament for ſecurity of thoſe who have taken or ſhal take the Covenant, doth or may ſuppoſe ſome fault, or ſomewhat juſtly challengable in the taking of the Covenant, which needeth ane Act of indemnity. Next the offer is but conditionall, and hath in the boſome of it ane complication of ſuch &amp; ſo many conditions as might open a door to ſome evaſion or other, by multiplying excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, difficulties, and various notions, either concerning the profeſſions of thoſe who have entred into the League and Covenant, or concerning his Majeſties juſt power &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43214:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>or concerning his freedom, honour, &amp; ſafety, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a free Parliament. And although the conceſſion were certain &amp; abſolute, it amounts to no more, but to a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Covenant arbitrary; which is contrary to the Acts of the Generall Aſſembly &amp; Parliament in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the Declaration of both Kingdoms before cited, &amp; to one of the chief Propoſitions of Religion once agreed upon by both Kingdoms, for a ſafe &amp; wel-grounded peace; <hi>viz.</hi> The Propoſition concerning his Majeſties ſwearing &amp; ſigning of the League &amp; Covenant, and enjoyning by Act of Parl: in both Kingdoms the taking thereof by all the Subjects in the three Kingdoms, with ſuch penalties as ſhal be agreed upon by both Kingdoms: ſo that the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of his Majeſties offer is a moſt manifeſt altering of the ſtate of this cauſe; It is alſo a ſtrengthning of the hearts &amp; hands both of the Sectaries and of the Malignant party, a partaking and conniving at the ſin of all thoſe in the three Kingdoms who have refuſed, or ſhall refuſe to enter into the League and Covenant, an introducing of a deteſtable indifferency or neutrality in this cauſe which ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the glory of God, the good of the Kingdom, and the honour of the King. And therefore we have judged this Article not only unſatisfactory, but deſtructive to the Covenant. Neither are we moved with that objection which is hinted, concerning the conſtraining or inforting of mens conſciences: They refuſe a neceſſary duty who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take the Covenant; and the penalty or puniſhment of ſuch refuſall is no conſtraining of the conſcience, more then the penalty or puniſhment of a Subject who refuſeth to take the Oath of Allegiance is a conſtraining of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Loyalty, or more then the puniſhment of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Blaſphemers, and Seducers, mentioned ſo often in Scripture, can be called a conſtraining of the conſcience to the fear of of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43214:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The words of the ſecond Article are theſe: <hi>His Majeſty wil like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe confirm by Act of Parliament in</hi> England, <hi>Preſbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Directory for Worſhip, and Aſſembly of Divines at</hi> Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>for three years, ſo that his Majeſty and his houſhold be not hindered from uſing that form of Divine Service he hath formerly practiſed; and that a free debate and conſultation be had with the Divines at.</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter <hi>(twenty of his Majeſties nomination being added unto them) and with ſuch as ſhall be ſent from the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>whereby it may be determined by his Majeſty and the two Houſes how the Church Government after the three years ſhall be fully eſtabliſhed according to the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ought we know the conditions couched in the firſt Article are alſo to be underſtood in this and the following Articles: However this ſecond Article as it is but the ſame in ſubſtance with ſome of his Majeſties conceſſions in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Meſſages, ſo that which is propoſed in it, is but a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of Presbyteriall Government in <hi>England,</hi> and that but for three years, and is a direct allowance, at leaſt of the Book of Common Prayer in his Majeſties Houſhold: and moreover, by the ſecond Article not only a door is left o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for re-eſtabliſhing Prelacy and the Service Book; But the happy progreſſe already made in the Reformation, and uniformity of Religion according to the Covenant in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, Directory of Worſhip, Form of Church Government &amp; Catechiſme is ſet aſide as ſo much loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in order to a future ſetlement. Free debate with any of the Prelaticall party nominated by his Majeſty (when there was any ſuch occaſion) hath not bin declined: But we have great cauſe to be tender of unſetling and razing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good foundation already laid in the work of Reformation. And whereas his Majeſty will have it determined by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the two Houſes, how the Church Government after the ſaid three years ſhall be eſtabliſhed according to the Word of God: This doth at once cut off three of the moſt materiall Propoſitions concerning Religion former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43214:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>agreed upon by both Kingdoms, and from both ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to his Majeſty, (though ſome of them be now laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by the two Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>) namely. The third Propoſition, <hi>for aboliſhing Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> The fifth Propoſition, <hi>That Reformation of Religion according to the Covenant be ſetled by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in ſuch manner as both Houſes have agreed, or ſhall agree upon after conſultation had with the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;</hi> And the ſixth Propoſition, <hi>That ſuch unity and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity in Religion according to the Covenant, as after conſultation had with the Divines of both Kingdomes, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>is, or ſhall be joyntly agreed by both Houſes of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>and by the Church and Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>be confirmed by Acts of Parliament of both Kingdoms reſpectively.</hi> Of which three Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there can be no hopes as to his Majeſties conſent or concurrance) if the offer now made concerning a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by his Majeſty and the two Houſes, be compared with his Majeſties claiming of a negative voice, and with his Meſſage of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 16. in which He declared that both in relation <hi>as he is a Christian and as a King, he cannot give His conſent to the aboliſhing Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that this Order was placed in the Church by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves, and that his Majeſty is alſo bound by his Coronation Oath to maintain it. And this Meſſage of <hi>November</hi> 16. His Majeſty adhereth unto, in his Anſwer to the Bills and Propoſition, preſented to him at <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Caſtle; which Anſwer is dated <hi>Decemb.</hi> 28. and ſo after his Majeſties Letter to us. Upon theſe and the like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have found the ſaid ſecond Article of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties offers in point of Religion to be deſtructive to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Government, the Directory of Worſhip, and the uniformity intended according to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43214:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For the third Article delivered to us in theſe words. <hi>And for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Schiſme and Hereſies his Majeſty is content and moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that an effectuall courſe be taken by Act of Parliament, and all other ways needfull and expedient for ſuppreſſing the opinions and practiſes of Antinomians, Arians, Socinians, Antiſcripturiſts, Anabaptiſts, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, Familiſts, Browniſts, Separatiſts, Independent, Libertines, and Seekers, and generally for ſuppreſſing all Blaſphemy, Hereſie, Schiſm, and all ſuch ſcandalous doctrine or practiſes as are contrary to the light of nature, or to the known principles of Chriſtianity (whether concerning faith, worſhip, or converſation) or to the power of Godlineſſe, or which may be deſtructive to order or government, or to the peace of Church or Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we do Approve of the Suppreſſion of the particular Hereſies and Schiſmes ennumerate in his Majeſties offer; So we ſee not how it can be reconciled with his Majeſties Meſſage of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 16. in which there was a conceſſion to all ſuch as differ from Presbyteriall Government: And do further find the Article dangerous and defective in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Eraſtianiſm, and other dangerous errors, eſpecially Popery and Prelacy, which may prove deſtructive to the Covenant in miniſtring the occaſion to Papiſts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats to plead for a toleration, although the Covenant bind us to endevour the extirpation both of Popery and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</p>
            <p>Having now diſcovered the ſnares and dangers, We ſhall in the next place moſt humbly and ſeriouſly propoſe and recommend ſome wholſome ſeaſonable and pious counſels to all the members of this Church and Kingdom, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Honourable and High Court of Parliament, and to the Brethren of the Miniſtry, which may alſo ſerve to expreſſe our ſenſe concerning the whole matter contained in that narrative, delivered to us in writing, ſo far as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent and fit for us to give any Judgment thereupon.</p>
            <p>Firſt to all, we exhort all and every one to make more conſcience of endevouring a reall Reformation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43214:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>and their Families, and of the places in which they live, then ever yet they have done; to be more ſerious in ſearching their hearts, conſidering their waies, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit to perfect holines in the fear of God; to oppoſe wickednes and profaneſſe, promote the power and practice of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to be deeply humbled before the Lord for negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting theſe things ſo much, and ſo long; with all employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving Chriſts all-ſufficiency, and ſtriving to exerciſe faith in him for the grace of mortification and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as well as for remiſſion of ſins and peace with God; that being implanted and rooted in him, we may grow up as trees of Righteouſnes, the planting of the Lord that he may be glorified; for without amendment of life, and bringing forth of better fruit, the fierce wrath of the Lord cannot turn away from us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as men deſire they may not be led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but may be guided in ſafe and right paths, in the midſt of ſo great difficulties; Let them avoid the company and councell of the ungodly, whereby even good men, have been oft times moſt dangerouſly enſnared; Let all that fear God chooſe the Teſtimonies of the Lord for their counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, be much in prayer and ſearching the minde of God in his word without leaning to their owne underſtanding, or conſulting with fleſh and bloud in caſess of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſeeing 'tis no act of wiſdom but of folly, ſo to ſhun one danger as to run upon another as bad or worſe; Let us therefore avoid enemies and beware of dangers on all hands: We cannot ſee but the cauſe of God, the true Religion, the Covenant, Presbyteriall Government, this Church and Kingdom, and whatſoever is deareſt to us will be in as great danger, if the Prelaticall party prevail, as now they are into by the power &amp; prevalency of Sectaries in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who have made the Covenant and begun reformation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43214:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be laid aſide and hindered the promoting thereof. So that there is a neceſſity to be apprehenſive of dangers, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to remedies on both ſides, and to beware of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with, and connivance at Sectaries on the one hand, and Malignants on the other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when we ſpeak of Malignants, we deſire that the diſtinction may be remembred, which was mad in the ſolemn Warning to the Kingdom from the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1645. <hi>viz.</hi> That the cauſe is in very great danger from two ſorts of Malignant Enemies: Firſt, from ſuch as have openly diſplayed a Banner, or joyned in Armes and profeſſed Hoſtility againſt the cauſe, and ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heared thereunto: Secondly, from ſecret Malignants, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanters, and boſome Enemies. This ſecond ſort may by ſtill known by ſome Characters, given both at that time and before that time, As by their ſlandering or cenſuring the Covenant of the three Kingdomes and expedition into <hi>England,</hi> in the year 1643. as not neceſſary for the good of Religion, or ſafety of this Kingdom, or as tending to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Kings juſt Power and greatneſſe, By their confounding of the Kings Power and juſt Authority, with the pretence and abuſe thereof by Commiſſions, Warrants or Letters procured from his Majeſty by the Enemies of this cauſe and Covenant. As if none were Faithfull and Loyall to the King, who oppoſe ſuch men and their wayes; By their Spleen, Malice, and callumnies againſt ſuch as God hath made eminently inſtrumentall in this cauſe, and now reſolve to be conſtant to the end in their firſt Principles, as if ſuch men were the Kings Enemies who are moſt zealous for the good and ſafety of Religion; By their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, juſtifying or excuſing other known Malignants, and by their converſing or intercommuning with excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate delinquents. Unto which Characters time and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience give us, occaſion to adde ſome others, as namely,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43214:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>The unwillingneſſe and declining to reckon Malignants among the Enemies of this cauſe from whom danger is to be apprehended, Their disjoyning and dividing the duty of endeavouring the Kings Majeſties preſervation and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, from the duty of preſerving, defending, ſetling and ſecuring Religion; As if we might and ought to purſue the former without the latter while both are in danger; Their maligning of, and uttering malicious words againſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Zealous Miniſters, and againſt this meeting and Judicatory, appointed by the Generall Aſſembly: Laſtly, their crying up or down of parties perſons, &amp; even of the Sectaries themſelves according as they have more or leſſe hopes of advantage from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their own deſignes. For 'tis not long ſince ſuch men made light account of any dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers, which were apprehended from the prevalent faction of the Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> There being then ſome hopes of a compliance and combination between them and the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: Which is an infalible demonſtration that ſuch mens pretended Zeal againſt thoſe Sectaries now is not from the right Principle. Wherefore let all ſuch dangerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as we have here deciphered and be carefully obſerved and avoided, as men would keep themſelves pure, and free of ſnares: And let Presbyteries be diligent to diſcover, trie, and cenſure any of this kind in their bounds, that they may be able herein to give a good account of their diligence; As alſo that they be carefull to diſcover, try, cenſure any trafficking Sectaries, and all ſuch as favour their opions and wayes.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Though we eſteem that prevalent faction of Sectaries with their abbetters and adherents, Preſumptious and malicious Eenemies to Religion, King, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet we hold it is our duty to labour to remove and prevent all occaſions <hi>of jealouſies and ſuſpitions betwixt the Kingdomes; and to doe or ſay nothing that may breed miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43214:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>breake off correſpondence, weaken the confidence or infringe the union and peace betwixt the two Kingdomes ſo happily eſtabliſhed in His Majeſties preſence, and with his Royall conſent in both Parliaments;</hi> A caution as neceſſary now as when it was given above five years agoe in a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Commiſſioners of the Generall Aſſembly, met in this ſame place, <hi>Jan.</hi> 4. 1643. And Generally we deſire that all the Articles &amp; clauſes of the ſolemn League and Covenant may be kept inſeperably and inviolably lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together &amp; that there may be great tenderneſſe and care to avoid every thing which may be interpreted as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting or abandoning of the former principles, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, petitions, proteſtations, Remonſtrances, and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this Kirk and Kingdome in the purſuance of this cauſe; and more eſpecially to take good heed that <hi>Scotlands</hi> deſires, do not mount higher for the King, and fall lower in the point of Religion, then they were at our firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and ingagement in this cauſe.</p>
            <p>Finally, we do moſt ſeriouſly obteſt all the people of God in this Nation, and eſpecially the eſtates of Parliament, by their love to the cauſe of God, by their ſolemn Vowes and Covenants, by their firſt principles and profeſſions, by their former zeale and ſincerity, by the many bleſſings of God, and his great works done for us when our zeal and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was greateſt in this cauſe, and by all the curſes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God which his word denounceth againſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders and Covenant-breakers, that they may all the dayes of their lives continue firme, ſtedfaſt, and faithfull in their Covenant with God, and one with another, and make good their former profeſſions in a time of tentation and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without wavering or falling off to the right hand, or to the left, and as many as walke according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
